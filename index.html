					<p>Military people don't make out with science people. 
					I am never gonna see a merman, ever. 
					But I haven't spent any money! I was all... 
					dead and frugal. The only thing Willow was 
					ever good for, the only thing I ever had going 
					for me were those moments, just moments,
					where Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. 
					Don't care much for fancy parties. Too rough.
					Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?</p>

				<h1>Work</h1>
				<p> A whole mess of sparrows turning on a dime, salmon trucking
				upstream. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad
				guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black
				hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day. No one
				ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after. In the time
				of gods and monsters, what is the worth of a man? </p>

			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p> They rampaged through half the known world until Angel got his
			soul. It was like the Heimlich, with stripes! I like to think of
			myself more as a 'guest-age'. Woman, you are completely off your
			nut. I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons. Ah,
			the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots. How did your
			brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious. Time for some
			thrilling heroics. Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.
			Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to
			eat. </p> 
			<p> Well, I'm sure I'm in serious need of some moral
			spankitude, but guess who's not qualified to be my Rabbi? Uh,
			thermal exhaust port's above the main port, numbnuts. I've seen your
			kindness and your strength. We're gonna explode? I don't wanna
			explode. You're recently gay! And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose
			control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. So we'll
			integrate non-progressional evolution theory with God's creation of
			Eden. Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. </p> 
			<p> I'm not
			planning on presiding over the end of Western Civilization. I'm the
			one who brings about the thought-pocalypse. What, you think this
			isn't real just because of all the vampires, and demons, and
			ex-vengeance demons, and the sister that used to be a big ball of
			universe-destroying energy? I knew you were lying. Undead liar guy.
			Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to
			eat. </p>
